1.32    2006-07-03

  - Fixed version required for Sys::Hostname (thanks BARBIE)
  - plan tests (for compat with older harnesses)
  - keep a unique per pid part to fend of encroaching collisions (rjbs)

1.31    2004-12-22

  - Stopped using Time::HiRes. Instead, we generate a pseudo-
    random string.
  - Cache user portions of the address to ensure uniqueness.
  - Add purge_users() method, undocumented currently. Experimental.

1.2    2004-09-27

  - INCOMPATIBLE: Removed trigger code, just subclass to override behaviour.
